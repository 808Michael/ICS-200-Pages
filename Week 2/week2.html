    <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%93n%C4%93">Nene</a> is the state bird of Hawaii, descended from the Canadian goose. Based on fossil DNA, all Hawaiian goose species are closely related to the giant Canada goose and are thought to have migrated to the Islands over <strong>500,000 years ago</strong>. They've developed unique features like padded toes, claws, and less webbing on their feet to walk on rugged lava rocks.

      The Nene is the <strong>rarest</strong> goose in the world. Captain James Cook, upon arriving in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778, noted the goose was once common. However, hunting and predators like <em> mongooses, pigs, and cats </em> reduced the Nene population to just <strong>30 birds</strong> by 1952. Bred back from the brink of extinction and re-introduced into the wild, today, with 2,500 birds, it remains the <em> sixth-most endangered waterfowl species globally </em>.

      The Hawaiian name <em>“nene” </em> from the bird’s <em>soft</em>, almost gentle call. In olelo Hawaii (Hawaiian language), it means <em>“to chirp, as a cricket; to croak … whimpering, as a sleeping infant.”</em> The goose has also been known to <em>“moo”</em> like a cow.

      There are Hawaiian geese in England today. When the Nene were in danger of going extinct, English conservationist Peter Scott brought breeding pairs to his reserve in Slimbridge, England. Some were returned to Hawaii, but several hundred descendants still live at the reserve.

      One of the favorite foods of the Nene is the <strong>bright red ohelo berry </strong> that grows on lava, related to the cranberry and considered delicious. The ohelo berry is sacred to the volcano goddess <strong>Pele</strong>, and offerings of branches with fruit were thrown into <strong>Kilauea volcano</strong> on Hawaii Island by Hawaiian cultural practitioners.

      Nene are mentioned in the <em> Kumulipo (the Hawaiian creation chant) </em> as being guardian spirits of the land. In Hawaiian culture, they symbolize a joining force between the mountains and the coast due to their seasonal movements.

    <h3>Where To See Nene</h3>
    
    <p>
      Although most Nene live in remote areas, you can find them in places like Haleakala Crater on Maui, Kilauea Lighthouse on Kauai, and the Turtle Bay area on Oahu. The Honolulu Zoo also houses some tame Nene. The best place to see Nene in the wild is on Hawaii Island, with the largest number living in and around <strong>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</strong> Please remember to keep your distance, as they are federally protected and listed as an endangered species. It is unlawful to touch, feed, harass, or chase the Nene, and each bird is banded.
